## General info

### The challenge

- Build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
- It should be responsive.

### Where to find everything

- The designs, mobile and desktop version, can be found inside the `/design` folder.

- All the required assets (already optimized) are in the `/images` folder.

- There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
